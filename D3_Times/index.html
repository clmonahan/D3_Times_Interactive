          <br>
          <p>
            There appears to be a negative correlation between poverty levels the percentage of the population with healthcare coverage. 
            It also appears that people living in states with lower income levels are more likely to be obese and to smoke. 
          </p>

          <p>
            States with a younger population have lower rates of smokers, which is not surprising given that there is a nationwide ban on smoking under the age of 18. 
            Similarly, states with a young population are less likely to have high rates of healthcare coverage given that many states provide healthcare to adults above a certain age.
            These two correlations show how impactful government regulations can be on the well-being of citizens.
          </p>
          <p>
            The relationship between age and obesity is less clear, and it is possible that states with obese adults are more likely to also be states with obese children.
